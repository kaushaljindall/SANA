Mental Health Coping Strategies

1. Grounding Techniques (5-4-3-2-1 Rule)
If you feel overwhelmed or anxious, try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique:
- Acknowledge 5 things you see around you.
- Acknowledge 4 things you can touch.
- Acknowledge 3 things you hear.
- Acknowledge 2 things you can smell.
- Acknowledge 1 thing you can taste.
This helps bring your focus back to the present moment.

2. Box Breathing
Box breathing is a simple relaxation technique that can help reset your breath and reduce stress.
- Inhale for 4 seconds.
- Hold for 4 seconds.
- Exhale for 4 seconds.
- Hold for 4 seconds.
Repeat this cycle for a few minutes until you feel calmer.

3. Managing Anxiety
Anxiety can feel scary, but it is manageable. 
- Challenge negative thoughts: Ask yourself, "Is this thought based on fact or fear?"
- Limit caffeine and alcohol, as they can aggravate anxiety.
- Maintain a regular sleep schedule.
- Reach out to a trusted friend or professional if feelings persist.

4. Crisis Resources
If you or someone you know is in immediate danger, please call emergency services (911 in the US) or visit the nearest emergency room.
You can also contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline for 24/7 support.
